# Raith

Raith is a medieval fantasy universe created for text-based roleplaying purposes.
Additionally, it is the name of the stil in-development website which will allow the users to play when it will be grown enough.

### Organize your text-based roleplay easily !
Ultimately, the goal of this project is to make a user-friendly platform on which text-roleplaying enthusiasts can gather to play together. The new users will be joining the ongoing worlds or even create their own if they'd like to !  
Hopefully, the finished website will provide tools allowing the most creative players to develop their own universes according to an existing template or completely from the ground up.

### Specifications
Until further notice, the website will only be supporting French. We will of course welcome users from all around the world, but we do not plan to translate the site's content for now.
